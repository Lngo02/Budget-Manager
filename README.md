The code I wrote can be found in >'Budget Manager'>task>src\budget. The remaining code is provided by HyperSkill to automatically test the solution.

## About
Not to sound overly serious, but itâ€™s very important to manage your budget. This implies analyzing your expenses and estimating the income, which sometimes may be difficult to do yourself. Luckily, technology is there to assist: you can create your own personal budget manager program that counts the ins and outs and helps control the finances.

## Learning Outcomes
You will create a very applicable product, and in the meanwhile also get acquainted with the basic concepts of programming in Java. You will deal with the widest variety of tools: work with strings, perform mathematical calculations and sort the data.

## Stages

**Stage 1/5: Count my money**
Read purchases from the console and print the total amount.

**Stage 2/5: Make a menu**
Create a user-friendly menu for the program.

**Stage 3/5: Oh the things you can buy**
Make the manager smarter: create categories for your purchases to better analyze the user's spending habits.

**Stage 4/5: Memorable purchases**
Planning the budget is a lasting activity: enable the program to keep the history of expenses over time.

**Stage 5/5: Analyzer**
Teach your program to perform a concise analysis (sorting) of spendings.
